    I don't lecture nor do I have a 'curriculum'.  I do however make sure you have a solid knowledge base of what it takes to land that
    first job or internship.  I do this buy seeing where you're at and what you need to learn and then pointing you towards
    valuable material that covers those topics.  If you get stuck or need a clarification I will dive into a topic with you and clarify any confusion.
    Often people will exhaust the materials available to them but still feel inadequate working on a solo project or building their portfolio.
    At this point I will pair program with you on your projects and allow you to pair programm with me on my projects thus helping
    you get comfortable with the complexity of a production level code base. You'll also have the opportunity to spend a day or two shadowing me
    in the office and sit in on a sprint planning meeting.
