This will depend on what your goal/desired job is and how many hours a week you set aside to work towards it. That being said I work from home so if you only have a part time job and want to dedicate 30-40 hours a week to studying then I will be there to answer your questions, help you with your portfolio and identify any knowledge gaps that you'll need to fill before applying for jobs. If you work full time and can only set aside 10-20 hours a week to individual study then it will take longer to reach your goal but just the same I will be there to help you.
